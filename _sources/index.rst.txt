VBI Pipeline Documentation
===========================

This package provides a pipeline that produces Level-1 Science Data for the VBI instrument on DKIST.

Installation
------------
Let pip do the work:

.. code-block:: console

  $ pip install git+ssh://git@bitbucket.org:dkistdc/vbi-science-pipeline.git

Usage
-----
In its current form the pipeline is a stand-alone program that relies on a user-editable configuration file.
A completely blank file can be generated with:

.. code-block:: console

  $ vbi_pipeline -b config.ini

The file ``config.ini`` is editable with any standard editor. A config file with sensible defaults can be made by
swapping the `-b` flag with `-d`. Once this file has been correctly populated the data can be reduced with

.. code-block:: console

  $ vbi_pipeline config.ini

To avoid potentially unnecessary interpolation the main pipeline does not stitch together the full VBI FOV. This can
be done with the `vbi_stitch` command:

.. code-block:: console

  $ vbi_stitch INPUT OUTPUT

More information on the format/options of the configuration file can be found in the :doc:`config_file`.
