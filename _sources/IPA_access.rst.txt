Instrument Partner Testing Access
=================================

As of version 0.7.1 the pipeline also provides command-line level access to the individual modules of the VBI Pipeline.
These scripts are useful for testing and debugging each step of the VBI Pipeline individually. In each case they provide
complete access to each step's `main()` function, with all optional parameters exposed as command line options. Unless
set by the user the optional parameters fall back on the package defaults (the same as when running the main
``vbi_pipeline`` program).

The outputs of these scripts are suitable for use in the ``Main`` section of the standard configuration file.

Target Calibration
------------------

There are a lot of options here that should probably be left alone. Many of the defaults are critically important to
a successful TargetCal run.

.. warning::
  Target Calibration will likely fail if you do not provide both Dark Calibration (``-D``) and Gain Calibration
  (``-G``) objects.

Usage

    -D DARK_CAL, --dark-cal DARK_CAL
                          Location of Dark Calibration object FITS file. If none
                          is provided then no dark correction will be done.
    -G GAIN_CAL, --gain-cal GAIN_CAL
                          Location of Gain Calibration object FITS file. If none
                          is provided then no gain correction will be done.
    -g GAUSS_SIGMA, --gauss-sigma GAUSS_SIGMA
                          Width of smoothing kernel used to construct a binary
                          image from the input data. Should be slightly less
                          than the pixel width of the grid lines.
    -d DMAX, --dmax DMAX  Any intersections with pixel locations less than dmax
                          apart are considered to be the same intersection.
    -r RHO_MIN_DIST, --rho-min-dist RHO_MIN_DIST
                          Minimum distance (in Hough space coordinates) allowed
                          between peaks in rho. This parameter is highly
                          dependent on the pixel scale of the grid lines.
    -i REF_POS, --ref_pos REF_POS
                          Camera position to use as reference
    -R RHO_SMOOTH, --rho-smooth RHO_SMOOTH
                          Sigma of smoothing kernel used to remove noise from
                          the rho rss. Something b/t 5 and 10 is probably good.
    -t BINARY_THRESHOLD, --binary-threshold BINARY_THRESHOLD
                          Min percentage of pixels to be on one side of the Otsu
                          threshold when constructing the binary image. If the
                          percentage of pixels above the threshold is outside
                          the range (binary_threshold, 1 - binary_threshold),
                          then some cleaning of outlying pixels is performed.
    -P PEAK_THRESHOLD, --peak-threshold PEAK_THRESHOLD

                          [0 - 1]. Larger numbers will exclude shorter lines, but can
                          help if spurious lines are being detected.
    -w THETA_WINDOW, --theta-window THETA_WINDOW
                          Size of region (in radians) around the peak angles to include
                          when looking for peaks in the Hough rho dimension. Smaller numbers
                          can improve the centering of rho peaks.
    -s SIGCLIP, --sigclip SIGCLIP
                          Any pixels beyond sigclip standard deviations from the
                          mean are excluded from the binary thresholding
                          calculation.
    -p, --debug           If True the code will stop at each hdu (i.e., camera
                          position) and generate some diagnostic plots that show
                          the computed lines and grid intersections.
