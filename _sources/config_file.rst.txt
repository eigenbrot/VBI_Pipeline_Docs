Configuration File Format
=========================

The VBI Pipeline configuration file is in the standard INI format and contains a subset of the sections and options
listed below. All options in *italics* are optional; if they are not provided by the user then default values will be
loaded.

Main
----
This section controls the top-level Science reduction. All of the ``*_cal`` options point to files that will not exist
on the first run of the pipeline. Once these objects have been created a lot of time can be saved by reusing them for
any other science runs that have the same setup. It is also possible to regenerate only a subset of the intermediate
Calibration Objects by simply pointing the corresponding option to a file that doesn't exist.

:raw_sci_dir: Path to a directory containing all of the Object (i.e., science) FITS files that will be reduced

:data_set_id: A string that is used to refine the selection of data from ``raw_sci_dir``. Only files whose 'ID_003'
    metadata matches this parameter will be used. If left blank then all data in the ``raw_sci_dir`` will be treated as
    a single data set, which might produce some strange looking outputs. **Note** As a special case, if this option is
    "all" then each data set found in the directory will be reduced separately.

:output: Path to file in which to save the reduced output images. **Note:** In the cas where ``data_set_id = all`` this
    option defines the prefix used when saving each separate data set. They will be saved as OUTPUT_ID003.fits.

:dark_cal: The location of the processed DarkCalibration object. If this file does not exist it will be generated.

:gain_cal: The location of the processed GainCalibration object. If this file does not exist it will be generated.

:target_cal: The location of the processed TargetCalibration object. If this file does not exist it will  be generated.

:*final_average*: **(bool)** If 'True' then average all exposures from the same spatial position in the final data.
    In this case the output file will have a single HDU for each unique spatial position present. Default is False.

:flush: **(bool)** If 'True' then the VBI Pipeline will try to write intermediate data products and read them using
    memmap in an attempt to save on memory usage. This results in a slight performance hit, but might be the only way
    you can get a huge data set to process without running out of RAM.

:*sci_suffix*: The file suffix for Science data files. Default is "FITS".

DarkCalibration
---------------
This section is only relevant if the file referenced by ``Main.dark_cal`` does not exist.

:raw_dark_dir: Path to a directory containing the dark frames to use during reduction. Can be the same as
    ``Main.raw_sci_dir``.

:*low_acceptance_threshold*: **(float)** This sets the lower limit for the fraction of outlying pixels that are allowed
    in a good DarkCalibration object. If the fraction of pixels in the object that are less than 1 stddev away
    from the mean is less than 0.682 - low_acceptance parameter an error will be thrown.

:*high_acceptance_threshold*: **(float)** This sets the lower limit for the fraction of outlying pixels that are allowed
    in a good DarkCalibration object. If the fraction of pixels in the object that are less than 1 stddev away
    from the mean is more than 0.682 + low_acceptance parameter an error will be thrown.

:*suffix*: File suffix of raw Dark data files. Default is "FITS"

GainCalibration
---------------
This section is only relevant if the file referenced by ``Main.gain_cal`` does not exist.

:raw_gain_dir: Path to a directory containing the gain frames to use during reduction. Can be the same as
    ``Main.raw_sci_dir``.

:*low_acceptance_threshold*: **(float)** This sets the lower limit for the fraction of outlying pixels that are allowed
    in a good GainCalibration object. If the fraction of pixels in the object that are less than 1 stddev away
    from the mean is less than 0.682 - low_acceptance parameter an error will be thrown.

:*high_acceptance_threshold*: **(float)** This sets the lower limit for the fraction of outlying pixels that are allowed
    in a good GainCalibration object. If the fraction of pixels in the object that are less than 1 stddev away
    from the mean is more than 0.682 + low_acceptance parameter an error will be thrown.

:*suffix*: File suffix of raw Gain data files. Default is "FITS"

TargetCalibration
-----------------
This section is only relevant if the file referenced by ``Main.target_cal`` does not exist.

:raw_grid_dir: Path to a directory containing the observations of the GOS calibration grid. Can be the same as
    ``Main.raw_sci_dir``.

:*refidx*: **(int)** The camera position (0-indexed) to use as the reference position when computing the sub-pixel, WCS
    shifts for all frames (i.e., TargetCalibration). Whatever position you choose should overlap with all other
    positions.

:*rho_smooth*: **(int)** The smoothing kernel (in pixels) to use when smoothing rho vectors in the Hough Transform. More
    smoothing can help with dirty detectors or GOS line grids, but too much might reduce the accuracy of the
    TargetCalibration.

:*gauss_sigma*: **(float)** The smoothing kernel (in pixels) used to help identify grid lines. This number should be close
    to the pixel width of the lines themselves.

:*rho_min_dist*: **(float)** The minimum separation (in pixels) allowed between lines identified by the Hough Transform.
    Unfortunately, the 'pixels' referenced here do NOT necessarily correspond to pixels on the image.

:*dmax*: **(float)** The maximum radial distance (in pixels) between two grid intersections in different camera positions
    where the intersections are called the same.

:*binary_threshold*: **(float)** This is used to clean up the binary grid image that is passed to the Hough Transform.
    If the percentage of pixels above the binary threshold is outside the range (binary_threshold, 1 - binary_threshold)
    then some cleaning of outlying pixels is performed.

:*sigclip*: **(float)** Another way to keep the binary image clean. Any pixels more than sigclip standard deviations away
    from the image mean are ignored.

:*peak_threshold*: **(float)** Relative cutoff for detecting peaks in the Hough transform [0 - 1]. Larger numbers will
    exclude shorter lines, but can help if spurious lines are being detected.

:*theta_window*: **(float)** Size of region (in radians) around the peak angles to include when looking for peaks in
    the Hough rho dimension. Smaller numbers can improve the centering of rho peaks. Default is pi/360.

:*bimode_choice*: **(list)** You'll hopefully never need this. Sometimes the camera offsets can be such that the distribution
    of offsets between camera positions is bi-modal. If this option is not specified then the user is asked to manually select
    which mode to use. For future runs you can specify a list of automatic choices so user input is not needed. The format
    is a list of lists, one [x, y] list for each camera position. The [x, y] lists contain your choice of mode for the x and y
    shift directions. The choice must be either 1 or 2; 1 always selects the mode closest to the global median and is almost always
    the correct choice. Example (for VBI-RED, which has 4 camera positions): ``[[1,1], [2,1], [1,1], [1,2]]``. **NOTE:**
    You can also specify a single number to select the same option for all camera positions. For example, set it to ``1`` if
    you just want to always choose the strongest mode and not be bothered. **NOTE (pt2):** There are some secret options:
    if you select either -1 or -2 then the shift will be exactly the selected median and the algorithm will not be re-run.
    If you select 0 then the global median is used and the algorithm is not re-run.

:*suffix*: File suffix of raw grid data files. Default is "FITS"
